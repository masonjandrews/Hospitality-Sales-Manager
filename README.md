THIS PROJECT IS UNFINISHED -- NET SALES ARE NOT WORKED OUT NOR WRITTEN

# Hospitality Sales Manager
 A tool to work out, record, store, and manage sales figures for a Hospitality business.

USAGE:
    "python sales.py"
    
    At the end of each trading day, enter your gross sales figure (this can usually be gathered from a print out from your till)
    The program will automatically calculate the net sales and store it in a csv file for easy access.
    This csv file can then be used as proof of sales figures, and can be read and modified manually.

NOTE:
    The program will always use the previous days sales figure to work out the current days sales, issues can occur when days are missing. A simple fix for this is to manually edit the csv file with the missing days' data.

CSV OUTPUT:
    Date, gross sales, net sales
